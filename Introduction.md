## <a name="What"></a>What is Lisk?

### <a name="Explanation"></a>Explanation of Lisk Platform

**Lisk** is a crypto-currency and decentralized application platform. As a crypto-currency, much like Bitcoin and other alternatives, it provides a decentralized payment system and digital money network. The network itself, operates using a highly efficient Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (**DPoS**) consensus model, that is secured by 101 democratically elected delegates. The Lisk decentralized application platform, it's most powerful component, allows the deployment, distribution and monetisation of decentralized applications and custom blockchains (sidechains) onto the Lisk blockchain.

Its (as project) started as a fork of Crypti beginning with an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to decide the initial distribution and raise development funds. The ICO raised $5.8 million and, at the time, was the second most successful cryptocurrency crowdfund (later that month, WAVES and The DAO would surpass it). On May 24, 2016, the mainnet for Lisk went live and it became available for trading on major exchanges.


### <a name="DPoS"></a>Delegate Proof of Stake

Proof of Delegates is the consensus algorithm used by Lisk. It combines elements taken from the Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Delegated Proof of Stake (DPoS) consensus algorithms.

The Lisk network is secured and/or protected by 101 active delegates. Each delegate is elected by the stakeholders of LSK. Once voted into the list of active delegates they are given the authority to generate blocks. Every Lisk stakeholder can be a part of the electoral process, by placing votes for delegates in their favour, or by becoming a candidate themselves.
The duty of the 101 active delegates is to secure the Lisk main blockchain (i.e. the mainchain). In order to provide an incentive to secure the network, transaction fees on the network are distributed equally amongst the 101 active delegates. In addition, an inflationary block reward (aka forging reward) is distributed to each block generator.


### <a name="Sidechains"></a>Sidechains

A Lisk sidechain is a custom block**chain**, which is a fully autonomous blockchain secured by its own nodes. Every blockchain app is running in its own, unique and secure sidechain - a blockchain you can fully customise. Encapsulating the blockchain app sidechains from the main blockchain of Lisk keeps the network lean, efficient, and fast.
**Sidechains** are an independent cryptographic ledger that attaches to the main blockchain, but does not impact the speed or security of the main chain. All the sidechain uses the same consensus protocol of the Lisk mainchain, the DPoS.



### <a name="Blockchain_Application"></a>Blockchain Application

Lisk Blockchain Apps are blockchain based applications which run on a custom sidechain. They are secured by a group of 101 master nodes elected by the app's owner, and operate using the same Delegated-proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism as the parent Lisk network.

#### Features:

* Delegated-proof-of-stake (DPOS) consensus mechanism
* Centralized and decentralized application storage options
* Custom token issuance and exchange
* LISK deposits / withdrawals
* Sandboxed virtual machine

#### Development

Lisk Apps are written using existing web technologies:

* Backend: NodeJS/JavaScript
* Frontend: CSS3/HTML5/JavaScript

Developers already familiar with these technologies, will quickly find their comfort zone, and can start building blockchain applications in very little time at all.

Using the provided command line interface: Lisk CLI. Developers can easily generate a new genesis block for their app's sidechain, clone the Lisk App SDK as a base project structure and create new contracts.

If you are just starting out, then before progressing any further. We strongly suggest learning the basics of the JavaScript programming language and NodeJS runtime.



### <a name="Digital_Currency"></a>Digital Currency LSK

Lisk is a cryptocurrency and its token is called **LSK**. To send LSK from one account to another takes 10 seconds, after about 1â€“2 minutes the transaction can be deemed immutable.
