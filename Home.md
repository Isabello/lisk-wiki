## What Is The Lisk Platform?

Lisk is a public blockchain platform and framework to develop decentralized, blockchain-based applications in JavaScript. Developers may build blockchain applications which utilize their own sidechain interlinked to the Lisk platform. Thanks to the scalability and flexibility of sidechains developers can implement and customize their blockchain applications entirely. Lisk is a non-profit organization, founded in 2016 by Max Kordek and Oliver Beddows.

#### History of Lisk

Lisk started as a fork of Crypti beginning with an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) to decide the initial distribution and raise development funds. The ICO raised $5.8 million and, at the time, was the second most successful cryptocurrency crowdfund (later that month, WAVES and The DAO would surpass it). On May 24, 2016, the mainnet for Lisk went live and it became available for trading on major exchanges.
